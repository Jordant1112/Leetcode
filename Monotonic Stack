### 739 Daily Temperatures
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, 
return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. 
If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.

Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]

class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(temperatures)
        res = [0]*n
        stack = []
        for day, temp in enumerate(temperatures):
          while stack and temperatures[stack[-1]] < temp:
            prevday = stack.pop()
            res[prevday] = day - prevday
          stack.append(day)
        return res


## 496 Next Greater Element I
The next greater element of some element x in an array is the first greater element that is to the right of x in the same array.\
You are given two distinct 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 is a subset of nums2.
For each 0 <= i < nums1.length, find the index j such that nums1[i] == nums2[j] and determine the next greater element of nums2[j] in nums2. 
If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is -1.
Return an array ans of length nums1.length such that ans[i] is the next greater element as described above.

Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.

My Solution:  Same as the discussion which utilize dict(cache) to store and return the remaining
class Solution:
    def nextGreaterElement(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = [nums2[0]]
        d = {}
        res = []
        for i in range(1,len(nums2)):
            while stack and stack[-1]< nums2[i]:
                d[stack[-1]] = nums2[i]
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(nums2[i])
        while stack:
            d[stack[-1]] = -1
            stack.pop()
        print(d)
        
        for i in nums1:
            res.append(d[i])
        return res


### 1762 Buildings With an Ocean View
There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.
The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. 
Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.
Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.

class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []
        for index, height in enumerate(heights):
            while stack and heights[stack[-1]] <= height:
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(index)
        return stack


### 155 Min Stack
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:

MinStack() initializes the stack object.
void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
int top() gets the top element of the stack.
int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.
 
 
Input
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

Explanation
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2

## Note: Always keep track of the minimum value so that the function could work properly.

class MinStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        if not self.stack:
            self.stack.append((val, val))
            return
        cur_min = self.stack[-1][1]
        self.stack.append((val, min(val, cur_min)))

    def pop(self) -> None:
        self.stack.pop()

    def top(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1][0]

    def getMin(self) -> int:
        return self.stack[-1][1]


## 896 Monotonic Array

An array is monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or monotone decreasing.
An array nums is monotone increasing if for all i <= j, nums[i] <= nums[j]. 
An array nums is monotone decreasing if for all i <= j, nums[i] >= nums[j].
Given an integer array nums, return true if the given array is monotonic, or false otherwise.

Input: nums = [1,2,2,3]
Output: true

Input: nums = [6,5,4,4]
Output: true

class Solution:
    def isMonotonic(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        increase = decrease = True
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:
                decrease = False
            if nums[i] < nums[i-1]:
                increase = False
        return decrease or increase


## 134 Gas Station

There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is gas[i].
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith station to its next (i + 1)th station. 
You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, 
otherwise return -1. If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique

Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.


class Solution:
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas: List[int], cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(gas)
        if (sum(gas) - sum(cost) < 0):
            return -1
        
        gas_tank, start_index = 0, 0
        
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            gas_tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            
            if gas_tank < 0:
                start_index = i+1
                gas_tank = 0
            
        return start_index
