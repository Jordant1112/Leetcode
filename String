## 953 Verifying an Alien Dictionary
In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. 
The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.
Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet, return true if and only if the 
given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.


Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

class Solution:
  def isAlienSorted(self, words, order) -> bool:
    d = {}
    for idx, l in enumerate(order):
      d[l] = idx
    
    for i in range(len(words)-1):
      for j in range(len(words[i]):
        if j >= len(words[i+1]):
          return False
        if words[i][j]!= words[i+1][j]:
          if d[words[i][j]] > d[words[i+1][j]]:
            return False
          break
    return True
