## 202 Happy Number (龟兔赛跑问题)
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1


class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def get_next(number):
            total_sum = 0
            while number > 0:
                number, digit = divmod(number, 10)
                total_sum += digit **2
            return total_sum
        
        slow = n
        fast = get_next(n)
        while fast != 1 and slow != fast:
            slow = get_next(slow)
            fast = get_next(get_next(fast))
        return fast == 1
        
### 345. Reverse Vowels of a String  
Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.

The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both cases.
 Input: s = "hello"
Output: "holle"
class Solution(object):
    def reverseVowels(self, s):
        vowels = set(list("aeiouAEIOU"))
        s = list(s)
        ptr_1, ptr_2 = 0, len(s) - 1
        while ptr_1 < ptr_2:
            if s[ptr_1] in vowels and s[ptr_2] in vowels:
                s[ptr_1], s[ptr_2] = s[ptr_2], s[ptr_1]
                ptr_1 += 1
                ptr_2 -= 1
            if s[ptr_1] not in vowels:
                ptr_1 += 1
            if s[ptr_2] not in vowels:
                ptr_2 -= 1
        return ''.join(s)
